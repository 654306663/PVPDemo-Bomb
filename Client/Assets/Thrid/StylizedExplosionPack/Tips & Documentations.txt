Tips and tutorials: StylizedExplosionPack1

How to apply the glow on explosions and environment:

1. Rightclick on the projectview and click on Import Package/Effects
2. Attach the bloom script on the MainCamera
3. Make sure to have a high threshold so the explosions does not get over-exposed.

Addding glow can be done in multiply ways, this one is free and easiest to do.


How to make new colored explosions

1. Copy the template folder (ExplosionPack1/Assets/explosions/Template)
2. Drag out the prefab into the sceneview
3. Open up the tabs in ParticleColorChanger script and start changing the color values.
Values saves in realtime.

tips:
4. You can copy the script component and place it on other explosion prefabs. 
Make sure to revert the "Colored_Particle_System"'s on the new explosion so you
are configuring the right components.

Optimization tips:
If you aim for optimized explosions I recommend using the alphaBlend_glow instead of the alphaBlend_depthBlend_glow which are located on most smoke effects.

The debris particle systems are emitting most partciles, disable these if going for optimization.
All around all smoke particles can be reduced in emittion if needed. (Inside the Particle System, Emission, lower the count in burst or time, spawns less particle)

Shader documentation:
alphaBlend_glow
A material that works that communicates with the particle system alpha and similar Shuriken properties.
Emission can boosted to give out a glow effect (if using bloom script on the Camera or similar).
Shader was made in ShaderForge.

alphaBlend_depthBlend_glow
Includes a detphBlend component which makes the smoke blend better into the ground. It is a bit more exepensive performence-wise, if there is any problems 
use the optimized_glowmaterial shader instead if needed. It just removes the depthBlend option.
Earlier version of this package used this shader in the explosion. The shader is recommended for higher performence machines because in some cases do not work on mobiles.
This shader was made in ShaderForge.

v1.01
Both shaders (optimized_glowMaterial & glow_depthBlend_material) were changed to alphaBlend_glow and alphaBlend_depthBlend_glow were enabled in OpenGLS ES 3.0
inside Shaderforge which made them work for android phones from 4.4.2(Kit Kat) and tested in Unity from 2.3.1 (Gingerbread). 
I will be testing on more devices when possible.
Shaders are currently directly from ShaderForge but the explosions uses low resolution textures, carefully placed particles and largest explosion is currently 6 drawcalls.

If possible I aim to replace the shaders into something more optimized, but for now they seem to be working in most cases.
Added optimization tips in this text file.
All explosions now use only use the alphaBlend_glow and unitys built-in mobile additive shader mainly so it works on mobiles without having to change shaders.

v1.02
Optimized alphaBlend_glow shader by removing the color value. The colors have been slightly altered because of it and I have been tweaking all the colors so they look like marketing product again.
Also rebuilt the scene so it has baked lightning

v1.03
Verified explosions work in IOS devices now.
Also added a lowpolysphere so smokepuffs can be replaced and used in VR environment
